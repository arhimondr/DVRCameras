Android client application for AV-TECH AV787 monitoring system.

Probably will work with other devices, however tested just on AV787.

Created just for fun. IRL you can just use EagleEyes from GooglePlay.

----------

Create .apk using

mvn clean install

You will need

JDK 1.6+
Android SDK with 2.2 platform
Maven 3.0.4

Also you must set:
JAVA_HOME="/path/to/your/jdk"
ANDROID_HOME="/path/to/your/android/sdk"
